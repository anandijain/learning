<!-- Your final assignment this quarter consists of three parts. It should be emailed as a single file with your first name (as you have asked to be called in class) in the title of the document. As always, include page numbers.

    1. A cover letter (400-500 words) in which you reflect on what you’ve learned in PIR this quarter. The cover letter should serve as an introduction to your Canvas portfolio. Imagine it as the introduction to a short anthology. What overarching themes and questions animate your reading responses? 

    2. A portfolio of 4 Canvas posts (250-500 words each). One of these must be about Arendt, and the remaining three are up to you. You should choose the four canvas posts you are most excited about or proud of, and plan to revise them. Aim to develop or meditate on one or two themes through your selections.

    3. A proposal for a creative case study (250-500 words). This proposal is in preparation for an assignment due at the end of spring quarter. The final project will require original writing but should take the form of something other than a typical paper. Possible forms include (and are not limited to) zine, soundpiece, poetry, photo essay, oral history project, and short film. This is NOT intended to be a research-heavy project. Rather, I expect that you all are weird, curious, passionate people, and I want you to consider how our readings this year relate to your ongoing personal and scholarly interests. 

For your proposal, (1) identify an object (case study, event, phenomenon, topic) that you could analyze through our readings so far this year. You might approach this in the opposite direction and identify a theoretical concern or common topos across the texts we’ve read, and speculate on you how you could relate this concern to a phenomenon in the world or how you might re-present and critique this theoretical concern in a creative project. Your proposal must (2) explicate how your object relates to the readings and (3) explain the form that your project may take. You are not locked into your proposal. I will give you written feedback, and we will discuss your proposals during office hours in spring quarter. If relevant to your proposed project, (3) you are encouraged to include 1-3 bibliographic references to materials beyond assigned class readings. -->

The primary conflict that I faced this quarter was wrestling with the implications that Smith and Marx's economic models have.

Deriving 

For example, Smith's model asserts that it is infeasible to compute the optimal actions for agents in a society, and that self-interest is the only way to maximally progress society. 

Pf. Assume not, 


in reading about the primary necesities of Adam Smith's government, I questioned the premise that this type of society could exist without accumulating regulations and corruption.

This caused me to wrestle with how a government maintains 

The primary lesson that I learned through this quarter was the fallacy of need. 
It was clear from the readings that human need does not drive behavior, but human desire.

Another issue that I struggled to reconcile was the nature of a commodity.
In Smith, the value of unproductive services perish the "instant of their performance" and "seldom leave any trace or value"

This helped me better understand that Kropotkin's ideal resource allocation is incomputable.

In my creative case study, I will create a series of soundpieces.

Sampling famous technologists and music technologists, my aim is to explore how the state of technology relates to the psychology and outlook of American opulence.


Adam Smith claims that self-interest is the foundation of an advancing society, stating that the society that enables individuals to maximally exercise their own judgement, will achieve "that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people."

Marx proposes an equation to demonstrate the key characteristic of a capitalist mode of production, MCM', in which capital can be valorized to create a surplus value for the capitalist. He claims that 

I will demonstrate that the presumption that humankind will eventually reach a society that is opulent, or where the proletariat controls the means of production, or the "Right to Well-Being" being guaranteed to all is 1) an equivalent problem to instantiating Strong AI, and 2)fails to put bounds on the time complexity on each writer's algorithm for a humane society.

Marx makes the asumption that (1/2)^n reaches zero in a finite amount of time. By falsely assuming Atlanta arrives home on time,
Marx assumes a society can sustainably be maintained by a collective ownership of property.

Marx, in essence, makes a modal fallacy based on the quantization of class, making indistinguishable one proletariat from another, likewise with the capitalists. 

In the Communist Manifesto, Marx asserts that "Modern Industry ... cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers."

However, if we didn't apply this discretization, this statement would really be is, what humankind, therefore, produces, is its own obsolescence. 

I hope to show that this obsolescence is equivalent to opulence 

I hope to demonstrate a central chicken-and-egg problem that arises with reaching oppulence/communist revolution. This problem mainly being that, for the capitalist(s) to fully control the means of production, they would have to provide for the wants of all at the thermodynamic limit of efficiency. Otherwise, another capitalist would innovate and steal market share.

Marx's model proves helpful for identifying many dual components of a capitalist economy and makes 
He doesn't really apply his own theory, if capitalism is so great at productivity and development, then why is it that the falling rate of profit, as a result of competition, does not provide for the 

Starting from the industrial revolution, I follow the eras of computation and sound recording until the present day to reflect the progress of technology in allowing opulence to spread universally.
