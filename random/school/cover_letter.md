<!-- Your final assignment this quarter consists of three parts. It should be emailed as a single file with your first name (as you have asked to be called in class) in the title of the document. As always, include page numbers.

    1. A cover letter (400-500 words) in which you reflect on what you’ve learned in PIR this quarter. The cover letter should serve as an introduction to your Canvas portfolio. Imagine it as the introduction to a short anthology. What overarching themes and questions animate your reading responses? 

    2. A portfolio of 4 Canvas posts (250-500 words each). One of these must be about Arendt, and the remaining three are up to you. You should choose the four canvas posts you are most excited about or proud of, and plan to revise them. Aim to develop or meditate on one or two themes through your selections. -->
1. 

One of the biggest challenges I have with evaluating texts' is connecting each part of their model, not evaluating each part individually, but the framework as a whole.

Specifically in Marx, who spent a great deal of time explaining the dual relations between concepts, made understanding the basis of value fairly difficult.

Breaking down written logic into mathematical notation is one way that I think greatly improves my ability to comprehend the material.

For example, Smith's model asserts that it is infeasible to compute the optimal actions for agents in a society, and that self-interest is the only way to maximally progress society. 

in reading about the primary necesities of Adam Smith's government, I questioned the premise that this type of society could exist without accumulating regulations and corruption.

This caused me to wrestle with how a government, even with checks and balances, could avoid accruing corruption and unjust regulation.

The primary lesson that I learned through this quarter was the fallacy of need. 
It was clear from the readings that human need does not drive behavior, but human desire. 

Marx spends a great deal of time 

Another issue that I struggled to reconcile was the nature of a commodity.
In Smith, the value of unproductive services perish the "instant of their performance" and "seldom leave any trace or value"

This helped me better understand that Kropotkin's ideal resource allocation is incomputable.
