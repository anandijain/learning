Winter Quarter focuses on the work of central figures in modern political economy and social theory. The course highlights the organization of economic process and the ways in which it relates to social and political relations and institutions. The central questions are these: How historically distinctive is the modern form of capitalist economy? How can we approach the study of the cultures of capitalism? Is inequality an inevitable outcome of capitalist economic development? What is the role of power in economic life? How should we think about the relationship between political power and economic practice?

**Though you will always have at least one week’s warning, readings are subject to alteration as the quarter unfolds, depending on the needs and interests of the class. **


Accessibility 
Students who have Letters of Accommodation in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. For those without Letters of Accommodation, assistance is available to eligible students through Student Disability Services. Please contact Student Disability Services at 773-702-6000 or disabilities@uchicago.edu for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.

Attendance and participation
	This class has a seminar format. Attendance and participation are mandatory, which means that your grade will suffer if you miss classes or do not take part in class discussions. More than 3 absences will negatively affect your final grade. Absences for extracurricular events such as Model UN count towards your three absences, so plan accordingly. OF COURSE, we will work around major illnesses and other unexpected events, and the sooner you inform me of such things, the better.
	Students are expected to read the assigned texts in full before each class and be prepared to analyze them and offer their own comments. I approach the classroom as a forum for honing our ideas and arguments as well as discovering new avenues of thought. As part of this process, I expect you to take seriously points of view that may be unfamiliar to you or simply different from yours. Students should be prepared to defend their positions and argue their cases without resorting to personal attacks. We should also be willing to change our minds, and don’t be surprised when I stop halfway through a sentence to say that I’ve changed my mind. I expect students to act with generosity, encouraging your classmates to participate and responding to one another’s questions and interventions. Participation, chalk posts, and presentations count together for 25% of your grade.

Canvas posts	
	Each student is expected to share 8 substantive posts throughout the quarter. Of these 8 posts, you are **required** to post responses to Williams, Arendt, and two of the film screenings. Please have your text online by 11 am the day of class, at which point I will close the discussion board.
Your posts should be around 250 words. You can write about assigned readings, film screenings, and lectures, and feel free post additional media that relates to the course. You may want to consider: things you like and why you like them; things you don’t like and why that may be; things you don’t understand; connections to other texts, internal contradictions; how the text could help us understand contemporary social and political life. As always, you must properly cite any texts that you reference. It is acceptable and encouraged for you to respond to each other’s critiques and questions; this can count as a post. Occasionally, I will offer prompts for your reading responses.
For Section 11, those with last names starting with A-H should post for Tuesday, and those with last names starting with I-Z should post for Thursday. 
For Section 14, those with last names starting with A-L should post for Tuesday, and those with last names starting with M-Z should post for Thursday.

Film Screenings
	There will be multiple film screenings throughout the quarter. They will be held at 6:30 in Cobb 202 on Thursdays. You are required to attend at least two screenings and to post reflections on these films on Canvas.

Presentations
	Working in groups of two or three, students are responsible for presenting on the selected days. You are REQUIRED to meet with me in advance of your presentation; please be in touch by the Monday before your presentation to set up an appointment. You are required to email me the penultimate version of your presentation by 10 pm on Wednesday evening, at which point I will respond with feedback. You must submit your final draft by 9 am the day of class.
	For your presentation, each student is required to submit one discussion question based on the day’s readings. You should include a paragraph length response to your discussion question, along with textual evidence (1-3 quotes) to support your claims. The purpose of this exercise is to help you focus on interesting elements/claims/passages in the text and to develop strategies for coming up with a thesis for a written paper. As your questions will set the stage for class discussion that day, feel free to attract attention to unclear and complex aspects of the assigned reading. You need to be able to state your discussion question within five minutes, and it is 100% not necessary to summarize the reading or give background information about the author.
There is no “make up” for this assignment. If you miss your chosen date without having been excused in advance or without a good reason you will receive a zero. 
	If you are not presenting on a given day, you are obligated to interact with the presenters. This means answering their questions and asking presenters for clarification. 

Papers
You will be assigned three papers, each counting for 25% percent of your grade. Papers should be emailed by midnight on the dates indicated on the class schedule. Each student is allowed a 24 hour extension for ONE essay. However, if there are extenuating circumstances, please do inform me of these. Otherwise, for each day that your assignment is overdue, I will deduct 1/3 of a letter grade (e.g., A- becomes a B+). As always, plagiarism is unacceptable. Please see the university’s policy on this if you have questions. Papers must be paginated with standard formatting and citations and submitted as word documents unless otherwise specified. You are required to include your last name in the title of any assignments you email in. Points will be deducted if you do not follow formatting guidelines as specified on the assignment sheet.
	You are permitted to submit revisions on one paper this quarter. You must meet with me to discuss revisions.

Office hours and email policies
	I will be available for office hours from 1:30 to 2:30 on Wednesdays and by appointment. Please email ahead to confirm the location of our meeting. 
	I am not constantly on email, so do not expect immediate responses, and please remember that email is not a substitute for office hours. Of course, you should feel free to contact me to set up meetings, to answer logistical questions, and so on. For more substantial concerns, I will ask that we meet in person. Finally, when emailing instructors, keep in mind the appropriate tone and level of formality.

Title IX Resources and Mandated Reporting
As a faculty member, I am considered an “Individual with Title IX Reporting Responsibilities.” This means that if you disclose to me instances of sexual assault, sexual harassment, other sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I am required to share this information with the Title IX Coordinator of the University. This person’s job is to advise members of our community on their options regarding remaining anonymous, confidentiality, the University’s process for investigating complaints, and the University’s disciplinary process.
If you need someone to talk to who is not a mandated reporter, you can reach out to any of these confidential resources:
Sexual Assault Dean on Call (SADoC)……773.834.HELP
Student Health Service……………………773.702.4156
Student Counseling Service……………......773.702.9800 
Members of the Clergy……………………see spirit.uchicago.edu 

Writing Workshops 
Over the course of Winter Quarter 2020, the SOSC Writing Program will offer PIR students workshops on a couple of different themes. The first workshop, “How to use evidence,” will focus on how to best use the text as evidence to advance interpretive claims. The workshop will also cover the need to contextualize passages, the perils of quoting selectively, why you shouldn’t “let the evidence speak for itself,” and best citation practices. The second workshop, “The work of a paragraph,” will address the rhetorical function of a paragraph, what readers expect from a paragraph, how to judge when to start a new paragraph, and what to do to connect discrete paragraphs. 
 
Workshops are by registration only and space in the workshops is limited. You may register for any date, space permitting, but you may only sign up for one workshop in each week. The workshop schedule as follows:
