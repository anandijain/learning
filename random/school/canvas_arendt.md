# Arendt Canvas Post
Arendt largely clears up some of the more complicated parts of Marx, by separating labor and work.
However, the parts of greatest interest to me lied in the examination of the social and public spheres coming from Smith and Marx, as another form of exchange and exploitation.

There seem to be a decent number of parallels for social capital being akin to economic capital, for instance experience being the basis for our bitstring, in which mutual experience form the basis for culture and social capital. 
Just as goods provide for the nautral wants and desires of man, so too it seems that experience provide for these wants.
Even further, it seems experience is the sole value, in which goods and use value only provide an approximation.
In reality each meal we eat, each bar of iron we buy, despite some objective inevitable use, it never seems to satisfy the true experience we hope to fufill. 
Additionally, it made me wonder whether a sufficiently commoditized society inevitably commoditizes our experience into a unified frame of reference, in which social capital is monopolized in the same manner as economic capital.

I greatly enjoyed reading about the social realm, as it provided me the great insight to question the true value of commodities for myself.
