<!-- 

A proposal for a creative case study (250-500 words). This proposal is in preparation for an assignment due at the end of spring quarter. The final project will require original writing but should take the form of something other than a typical paper. Possible forms include (and are not limited to) zine, soundpiece, poetry, photo essay, oral history project, and short film. This is NOT intended to be a research-heavy project. Rather, I expect that you all are weird, curious, passionate people, and I want you to consider how our readings this year relate to your ongoing personal and scholarly interests. 

For your proposal, (1) identify an object (case study, event, phenomenon, topic) that you could analyze through our readings so far this year. You might approach this in the opposite direction and identify a theoretical concern or common topos across the texts we’ve read, and speculate on you how you could relate this concern to a phenomenon in the world or how you might re-present and critique this theoretical concern in a creative project. Your proposal must (2) explicate how your object relates to the readings and (3) explain the form that your project may take. You are not locked into your proposal. I will give you written feedback, and we will discuss your proposals during office hours in spring quarter. If relevant to your proposed project, (3) you are encouraged to include 1-3 bibliographic references to materials beyond assigned class readings. -->

In my creative case study, I will create a series of soundpieces.
Sampling famous AI and music technologists, my aim is to explore how the state of technology relates to the psychology and outlook of capitalism, and whether or not capitalism's existence presupposes its demise.

Adam Smith claims that self-interest is the foundation of an advancing society, stating that the society that enables individuals to maximally exercise their own judgement, will achieve "that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people."

I will demonstrate that the presumption that humankind will eventually reach a society that is opulent, or where the proletariat controls the means of production, or the "Right to Well-Being" being guaranteed to all is 1) an equivalent problem to instantiating Strong AI.

In the Communist Manifesto, Marx asserts that "Modern Industry ... cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers."

I hope to demonstrate a central chicken-and-egg problem that arises as a common theme in technological history in which the next technology is the one that is opulent, yet as each invention has bolder and bolder claims, we continually fail to create independent intelligence, but simultaneously play into Marx's prediction of the shortening of the working day and the increasing in the size of the labor reserve army.

The thesis is essentially the importance of agency in creating an opulent future.  

In connecting this to Marx, I hope to show that this technological task as up until now, been undoable, and that this demonstrates the continued existence for competition and capitalism. 
For the capitalist(s) to fully control the means of production, they would have to provide for the wants of all at the thermodynamic limit of efficiency. Otherwise, another capitalist would innovate and steal market share.

Starting from the industrial revolution, I follow the eras of computation and sound recording until the present day to reflect the progress of technology in allowing opulence to spread universally. 

There are many people that I'd like to include in the EP, as well as generally samples and snippets from various eras of American capitalism that characterize the time technologically. 

I don't believe there are any recordings of Alan Turing, but much of the EP will be based off of his work and computability theory.

Another theme that I would like to use is the idea of society as a mechanism and the impacts of the internet on the definitions of society.
