# notes for Democracy in America

## Intro
i1
```117: Little by little enlightenment spreads; one sees the taste for literature and the arts awaken; then the mind becomes an element in success; science is a means of government, intelligence a social force; the lettered take a place in affairs.
```

i2
``` 118: As soon as citizens began to own land other than by feudal tenure, and transferable wealth was recognized, and could in its turn create influence and give power, discoveries in the arts could not be made, nor improvements in commerce and industry be introduced, without creating almost as many new elements of equality among men. From that moment on, all processes discovered, all needs that arise, all desires that demand satisfaction bring progress toward universal leveling. The taste for luxury, the love of war, the empire of fashion, the most superficial passions of the human heart as well as the most profound, seem to work in concert to impoverish the rich and enrich the poor.
```

i3
``` 119: The gradual development of equality of conditions is therefore a providential fact, and it has the principal characteristics of one: it is universal, it is enduring, each day it escapes human power; all events, like all men, serve its development.
```

## Chapter 1
q11
``` 135: Nowhere have the great convulsions of the earth left more evident traces than in the Mississippi Valley. The whole aspect of the country attests to the work of the waters.
```

q12
``` It was there that civilized men were to try to build a society on new foundations, and applying for the first time theories until then unknown or reputed inapplicable, they were going to give the world a spectacle for which the history of the past had not prepared it.
```

## Chapter 2
q21
``` Go back; examine the infant even in the arms of his mother; see the external world reflected for the first time in the still-obscure mirror of his intelligence; contemplate the first examples that strike his eye; listen to the first words that awaken the sleeping powers of his thought; finally, attend the first struggles that he has to sustain; and only then will you understand where the prejudices, habits, and passions that are going to dominate his life come from.

```
The circumstances that accompanied their birth and served to develop them influence the entire course of the rest of their lives.

```
	* Initial conditions
	* moving away from autonomous agent model

```
America is the only country where one has been able to witness the natural and tranquil developments of a society, and where it has been possible to specify the influence exerted by the point of departure on the future of states.
```

```
 America therefore shows us in broad daylight what the ignorance or barbarism of the first ages hid from our regard.

```
	* Mars is next

```
the idea that gold and silver mines made the wealth of peoples: a fatal idea that has more impoverished the European nations that gave themselves to it, and destroyed more men in America, than have war and all bad laws together.
```
	* Value
```
Slavery, as we shall explain later,*3 dishonors work; it introduces idleness into society, and with it, ignorance and haughtiness, poverty and luxury. It enervates the forces of the intellect and puts human activity to sleep. The influence of slavery, combined with the English character, explains the mores and social state of the South.
```
	* Facts
```
It was not necessity that forced them to abandon their country; they left a social position they might regret and secure means of living; nor did they come to the New World in order to improve their situation or to increase their wealth; they tore themselves away from the sweetness of their native country to obey a purely intellectual need; in exposing themselves to the inevitable miseries of exile, they wanted to make an idea triumph.
```
	* Risk
```
Content to keep the seeds of trouble and the elements of new revolutions at a distance, the English government looked unworried on this numerous emigration. It even favored it with all its power and seemed hardly occupied with the destiny of those who came to American soil to seek refuge from the harshness of its laws. One would have said that it regarded New England as a region left to the dreams of the imagination, which one ought to abandon to the free trials of innovators.

```
	* letemgo

```
The English colonies, and this was one of the principal causes of their prosperity, always enjoyed more internal freedom and more political independence than the colonies of other peoples; but nowhere was this principle of freedom more completely applied than in the New England states.
```
	* bureaucracy 

```
In America, on the contrary, one can say that the township had been organized before the county, the county before the state, the state before the Union.

keep track of normative vs prescriptive arguments 

```A prescriptive statement suggests a course of action.
A normative statement is one that proffers subjective opinion rather than just making an assertion of fact.
"The walls of that room are painted green" is a statement that is neither normative nor prescriptive.
"The walls of that room are hideous in that shade of green" is a normative statement.
"The walls of that room should be painted a different color than green" is a prescriptive statement.
All prescriptive statements are normative statements, but not all normative statements are prescriptive.
