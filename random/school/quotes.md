	* 13: Whether this propensity be one of those original principles in hu- 
man nature, of which no further account can be given; or whether, 
as seems more probable, it be the necessary consequence of the fac- 
ulties of reason and speech, it belongs not to our present subject to 
enquire. It is common to all men, and to be found in no other race 
of animals, which seem to know neither this nor any other species of 
contracts.
	* 14:  It is not from the benevolence of the
butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but
from their regard to their own interest.'
	* 16: As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division 
of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by 
the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the 
market. When the market is very small, no person can have any en- 
couragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for 
want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce 
of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, 
for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour as he has occa- 
sion for. 
    * 22: Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society,
	* 29 And, lastly, what are the different circumstances which some- 
times raise some or all of these different parts of price above, and 
sometimes sink them below their natural or ordinary rate; or, what 
are the causes which sometimes hinder the market price, that is, the 
actual price of commodities, from coinciding exactly with what may 
be called their natural price. 
	* 30:But after the division of labour has once thoroughly 
	taken place, it is but a very small part of these with which a man’s 
	own labour can supply him. The far greater part of them he must 
	derive from the labour of other people, and he must be rich or poor 
	according to the quantity of that labour which he can command, or 
	which he can afford to purchase. The value of any commodity, 
	therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use 
	or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is 
	equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or 
	command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchange- 
	able value of all commodities. The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the 
	man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. 
	What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, 
	and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is 
	the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can 
	impose upon other people. What is bought with money or with 
	goods is purchased by labour, 
	* Smith 39: The labour of menial servants 
does not continue the existence of the fund which maintains and 
employs them. Their maintenance and employment is alto 
gether at the expense of their masters, and the work which they 
perform is not of a nature to repay that expense. That work 
consists in services which perish generally in the very instant 
of their performance, and does not fix or realise itself in any 
vendible commodity which can replace the value of their wages 
and maintenance. The labour, on the contrary, of artificers, 
manufacturers, and merchants naturally does fix and realise 
itself in some such vendible commodity.
	* Smith 59 though the market price of every particular commodity is 
in this manner continually gravitating, if one may say so, towards 
the natural price, yet sometimes particular accidents, sometimes 
natural causes, and sometimes particular regulations of police, 
may, in many commodities, keep up the market price, for a long 
time together, a good deal above the natural price. 
	* 423: As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as 
he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic indus- 
try, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the 
greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the 
annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, in- 
deed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows 
how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of dom- 
estic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; 
and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce 
may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he 
is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to pro- 
mote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always 
the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his 
own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more 
effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never 
known much good done by those who affected to trade for the pub- 
lic good.
	* 651: All systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being 
thus completely taken away, the obvious and simple system of nat- 
ural liberty establishes itself of its own accord. Every man, as long 
as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free to 
pursue his own interest his own way, and to bring both his industry 
and capital into competition with those of any other man, or order 
of men. The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty, in the 
attempting to perform which he must always be exposed to innu- 
merable delusions, and for the proper performance of which no 
human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of 
superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it 
towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the so- 
ciety. According to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has 
only three duties to attend to; three duties of great importance, in- 
deed, but plain and intelligible to common understandings: first, 
the duty of protecting the society from the violence and invasion of 
other independent societies; secondly, the duty of protecting, as far 
as possible, every member of the society from the injustice or 
oppression of every other member of it, or the duty of establishing 
an exact administration of justice; and, thirdly, the duty of erect- 
ing and maintaining certain public works and certain public insti- 
tutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual, or 
small number of individuals, to erect and maintain; because the 
profit could never repay the expence to any individual or small 
number of individuals, though it may frequently do much more 
than repay it to a great society. 

## marx
	* Marx 35: an immense accumulation of commodities,* its unit being a single commodity. (demonstrates $\in \mathbb{N}$, capitalist basis of value is commodities)
    * Marx 35: A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another.
	* 35: To discover the various uses of things is the work of history.
    * Marx 36: When treating of use-value, we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron.
	* 38: but as exchange-values they are merely different quantities, and
		consequently do not contain an atom of use-value, note: quantities of exchange is separate
    * Marx 39: The labour, however, that forms the substance of value,
is homogeneous human labour, expenditure of one uniform la-
bour-power. The total labour-power of society, which is embodied
in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that
society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour-
power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units.
Each of these units is the same as any other, so far as it has the
character of the average labour-power of society, and takes effect as
such; that is, so far as it requires for producing a commodity, no
more time than is needed on an average, no more than is socially
necessary. The labour-time socially necessary is that required to
produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and
with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time.
	* 40: The value of a commodity, there-
fore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the produc
tiveness, of the labour incorporated in it. 
	* 40: A thing can be a use-value, without having value. This is
the case whenever its utility to man is not due to labour. Such
are air, virgin soil, uatural meadows, c. A thing can be useful,
and the product of human labour, without being a commodity.
Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own
labour, creates, indeed, use-values, but not commodities. 
In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use-values, but
use-values for others, social use-values. 
    * Marx 40: The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant,
if the labour-time required for its production also remained
constant. But the latter changes with every variation in the
productiveness of labour. 
    * Marx 46: The same change in productive power, which
	increases the fruitfulness of labour, and, in consequence, the
	quantity of use-values produced by that labour, will diminish
	the total value of this increased quantity of use-values, provided
	such change shorten the total labour-time necessary for their
	production; and vice versa.
	* 88: In the course of time, therefore, some
portion at least of the products of labour must be produced with
a special view to exchange. From that moment the distinction
becomes firmly established between the utility of an object for
the purposes of consumption, and its utility for the purposes of ex-
change. Its use-value becomes distinguished from its exchange-
value. 
	* 88: In the direct barter of products, each commodity is directly
a means of exchange to its owner, and to all other persons an
equivalent, but that only in so far as it has use-value for them.
At this stage, therefore, the articles exchanged do not acquire
a value-form independent of their own use-value, or of the individ-
ual needs of the exchangers. The necessity for a value-form grows
with the increasing number and variety of the commodities ex-
changed. The problem and the means of solution arise simultane-
ously. 
	* 89: Since all commodities are merely particular equivalents of
money, the latter being their universal equivalent, they, with
regard to the latter as the universal commodity, play the parts
of particular commodities. 
    * Marx 210: The value of a commodity, it is true, is determined by the quan-
tity of labour contained in it, but this quantity is itself limited
by social conditions. If the time socially necessary for the pro-
duction of any commodity alters— and a given weight of cotton
represents, after a bad harvest, more labour than after a good
one — all previously existing commodities of the same class are
affected, because they are, as it were, only individuals of the
species, * and their value at any given time is measured by the
labour socially necessary, i.e., by the labour necessary for their
production under the then existing social conditions.
    * Marx 216: Now since his
work forms part of a system, based on the social division of
labour, he does not directly produce the actual necessaries which
he himself consumes; he produces instead a particular commod-
ity, yarn for example, whose value is equal to the value of those
necessaries or of the money with which they can be bought. The
portion of his day's labour devoted to this purpose, will be
greater or less, in proportion to the value of the necessaries that he
daily requires on an average, or, what amounts to the same thing,
in proportion to the labour-time required on an average to produce
them.
    * Marx 218: the values of the variable capital
and of the labour-power purchased by that capital are equal,
and the value of this labour-power determines the necessary
portion of the working-day; and since, on the other hand, the
surplus-value is determined by the surplus portion of the work-
ing-day, it follows that surplus-value bears the same ratio to
variable capital, that surplus-labour does to necessary labour.
    * Marx 244: in any given economic formation of so-
ciety, where not the exchange-value but the use-value of the prod-
uct predominates, surplus-labour will be limited by a given set
of wants which may be greater or less
    * 321:  The object of all development of the pro-
ductiveness of labour, within the limits of capitalist production,
is to shorten that part of the working-day, during which the work-
man must labour for his own benefit, and by that very shortening,
to lengthen the other part of the day, during which he is at liberty
to work gratis for the capitalist. 
	* 323 The labour realised in value, is labour of an average social quality;
		is consequently the expenditure of average labour-power.
	* 376 The union of all these simple instruments, set in motion by a single
motor, constitutes a machine. Babbage
	* 406 Machinery produces relative surplus-value; not only by di-
rectly depreciating the value of labour-power, and by indirectly
cheapening the same through cheapening the commodities that
enter into its reproduction, but also, when it is first introduced
sporadically into an industry, by converting the labour employed
by the owner of that machinery, into labour of a higher degree and
greater efficacy, by raising the social value of the article produced
above its individual value, and thus enabling the capitalist to
replace the value of a day's labour-power by a smaller portion of
the value of a day's product.
	* 429 It took both time and experience be-
fore the workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and
its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against
the material instruments of production, but against the mode
in which they are used.
	* 430 The whole system of capitalist production is based
on the fact that the workman sells his labour-power as a commodity.
	* 430 The self-expansion of capital by means of machinery is
thenceforward directly proportional to the number of the work-
people, whose means of livelihood have been destroyed by that
machinery. 
	* 440 
	* 461 analysing the process of production into its constituent phases,
and of solving the problems thus proposed by the application of
mechanics, of chemistry, and of the whole range of the natural
sciences, becomes the determining principle everywhere. 
	* 530 Only by suppressing the
capitalist form of production could the length of the working-day
be reduced to the necessary labour-time. But, even in that case,
the latter would extend its limits. On the one hand, because the
notion of `means of subsistence` would considerably expand, and
the labourer would lay claim to an altogether different standard of
life. On the other hand, because a part of what is now surplus-
labour, would then count as necessary labour; I mean the labour
of forming a fund for reserve and accumulation.
	* 530 2 The capitalist mode of production, while on the
one hand, enforcing economy in each individual business, on the oth-
er hand, begets, by its anarchical system of competition, the most
outrageous squandering of labour-power and of the social means of
production, not to mention the creation of a vast number of employ-
ments, at present indispensable, but in themselves superfluous.
	* 530 3 The intensity and productiveness of labour being given, the
time which society is bound to devote to material production is shorter, and as a consequence, the time at its disposal for the
free development, intellectual and social, of the individual is
greater, in proportion as the work is more and more evenly divid-
ed among all the able-bodied members of society, and as a par-
ticular class is more and more deprived of the power to shift the
natural burden of labour from its own shoulders to those of an-
other layer of society. In this direction, the shortening of the work-
ing-day finds at last a limit in the generalisation of labour. In
capitalist society spare time is acquired for one class by converting
the whole life-time of the masses into labour-time.
	*  
	* 554 society can no more cease to produce
than it can cease to consume. When viewed, therefore, as a con-
nected whole, and as flowing on with incessant renewal, every
social process of production is, at the same time, a process of re-
production.
	* 569: Variable capital is therefore only a particular historical form
		of appearance of the fund for providing the necessaries of life, or
		the labour-fund which the labourer requires for the maintenance of
		himself and family, and which, whatever be the system of social
		production, he must himself produce and reproduce.
	* Marx 612: The composition of capital is to be understood in a twofold sense. On the side of value, it is determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of production, and variable capital or value of labour-power, the sum total of wages. On the side of material, as it functions in the process of production, ll capital is divided into means of production and living labour-power
    * Marx 622: the degree of productivity of labour, in a given society, is expressed in the relative extent of the means of production that one labourer, during a given time 
    * Marx 622: the growing extent of the means of production, as compared with the labour-power in corporated with them, is an expression of the growing produc tiveness of labour.
    * Marx 622: This change in the technical composition of capital, this
growth in the mass of means of production, as compared with
the mass of the labour-power that vivifies them, is reflected again
in its value-composition, by the increase of the constant consti-
tuent of capital at the expense of its variable constituent. 
    * Marx 624: Every individual capital is a larger or smaller concentration of means of production, with a corresponding command over a larger or smaller labour-army. 
	* 627: In any given branch of industry cen-
tralisation would reach its extreme limit if all the individual
capitals invested in it were fused into a single capital. 1 In a
given society the limit would be reached only when the entire
social capital was united in the hands of either a single capitalist
or a single capitalist company.
