## thoughts 
	*  It seems like a big problem is addressing market efficiency, because largely as old technologies/commodities with depreciated value, may be more valueable as different technology comes about. Difference in market price and value
	*  In order to support a multi-currency model, it makes no difference that exchanging money is represented by a Trade, since any money can be expressed as the commodities of equivalent exchange value (really market price at current time).
	*  In Marx's model, we see that the distinction in constant and variable capital can be represented as the component parts of the total capital employed by a Person on the means of production and labor respectively. 
	*  To fit the model to this, we can express capital-labor exchanges (commodity production)? 
	*  It arises from a violation of Cauchy-Schwarz. Marx assumes that it is never the case that the labor of the worker is for goods that he actually consumes for subsistence. Dually, this violates that the worker would ever overwork themselves out of joy of the labor. If they are free laboreres, however, exploited to the limits of subsistence, can in improve the production process.
	*  How do we explain hourly wage, contracts, etc as commodity exchange. A contract's value is largely in the character of the judicial system.
	*  Need something on cooperation
	*  money
	*  to say that a capitalist never becomes a wage laborer or vice versa is wrong
	*  marx freq writes that the capitalists aim is capital augmentation, not necesarily commodity production.
	*  however where does he address that herein lies the labor of capitalists-asset allocation.
	*  the inner product of two uncountable vectors is still $\in \mathbb{R}$ but the degree of error for approximation this use-value is the challenge.
	*  it is clear that the distribution of portfolios will largely consist of subsistence commodities to be used for use-value, and that this sparsity prevents the exchange of commodities between traders when neither want the other's commodity for it's use value
	*  this brings about the money form of commodities, it is this shift that makes distinct a capitalist mode of production.
	*  you can expend labor and capital to gain information about the characteristics of a commodity that give a better approximation of its value, and subsequently market price. 
	*  to assume that a unified/collective revolution will take place is logistically impossible, it is much more likely that given the inherent flaws in commodity prices, the worst 
	*    if $can\_create\_ai()$ then $revolution=true$ else:  $revolution=false$ this is because the worker would have no barganing power, and theres no job that an ai couldn't do.
	*  alienation can be described by labor Trades in this model, where alienation is a vertex with a loop and an edge to another vertex, as this demonstrates the resulting commodity not being owned by the worker.
	*  @430 selling labor power is a basis but not the only 
	*  @430 2 if self-expansion of capital $~$ to \# of ppl displaced by it, does this imply that the expansion of capital is $~$ expansion of human knowledge? 
	*  the soln is knxwledge itself
	*  if the worker finds themselves dissatisfied with their life, but willing to give up a portion of their wages to remedy the problem, then there exists a market to deliver this want.

	*  social commodities (experiences/mutual culture) are in a similar position to currency, in that they don't exhibit any use-value and are akin to a service to Smith. This has the analogy of prices stabilizing as more of a given commodity is translated into various other commodities, likewise the exchange of culture is exhibited by human connectivity.
	*  worth/value ~ exhcange value/use value
	*  (does this also mean that from the set of all decisions forall possible trades exists a bijection to the persons bitstring) probably? 
	* is there even such a thing as the value of a commodity. if anything it would be the total expected value of all effects that the commodity has in future commodity production through its use. this seems to be non-trivial to compute, as it would require knowing f(t) and the effect of use-value consumption on each person's bitstring. We can't assume that a stimulus::use-value has the same effect on two different people 

## Essay Outline 
	* Thesis setup: Marx, extends the base model of individual liberty that leads to a capitalist mode of production as presented by Smith by describing the boundary conditions, in which a single monopolistic entity dominates and consequently leads to a post-capitalst, collectivist mode of production.
	* Thesis: A single monopoly is a correct consequence of a capitalist mode of production, but is a solution to a limit at t=infinity, therefore, we cannot say when this transition to post-capitalism will occur. 
	* Marx provides upper bounds on this eventuality, demonstrates that the wages of workers fall faster than the capitalists' profits, shown through defining surplus value. 
	* A consequence of this surplus profit, as shown by Smith, is distributed to the world in the form of lower cost products. 
	* This tendency of the rate of profit? to fall is a driving factor for future competition.
