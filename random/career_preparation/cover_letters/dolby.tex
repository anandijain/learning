Dear Dolby,

I am interested in the Machine Learning / Signal Processing Internship for Summer 2020.

As a lifelong musician and producer, this opportunity is extremely appealing to me.

I have extensive experience with git, python, and go (similar to C++), as well as using cloud APIs for databases, virtual machines, and flask applications.

I built a tool to generate white noise and apply filters to noise in C at /DSP/ and used a variational autoencoder to generate sound based off my personal songs at /sippyart/.

I see this opportunity as an exciting way to learn about low latency audio, networking, testing, and other interesting parts of large infrastructure that don't necessarily get taught in a class.

One area that I would like to learn more from a team about is how noise reduction is implemented and how hardware designs are constructed to optimally flatten the frequency response.

Thank you,
