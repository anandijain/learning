Dear Dropbox,

I am interested in being a Software Engineer Intern for Summer 2020.

I have extensive experience with Python, Git, Google Cloud, and SQL.

I have built a Go-lang based data-scraper for sports odds that initially took 20+ minutes in python, now takes 30 seconds and writes to a MySQL DB on Google Cloud.

I am interested in how larger scale data operations work and how to make scalable software and possibly use machine learning for load balancing.

I hope to hear from you.

Thank you,
