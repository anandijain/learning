Dear Nielsen,

I am interested in being a Data Science Internship for Summer 2020.

I have extensive experience with Python, Git, Google Cloud, and SQL.

I have built a Go-lang based data-scraper for sports odds that initially took 20+ minutes in python, now takes 30 seconds.

I am interested in how larger scale data operations work and how to find interesting correlations and abstractions in constrained and big-data scenarios.

I hope to hear from you.

Thank you,
