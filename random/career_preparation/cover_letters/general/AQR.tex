Dear AQR,

I am interested in the Research Analyst position for Summer 2020.
I have experience managing cloud instances, SQL databases, and on-line machine learning.
My project to track sports data is reflective of this. 
Initially in python and dreadfully slow, I could only gather a few sports every couple of minutes.
After porting my code to Golang and concurrently requesting REST endpoints, I am able to track 2000+ sports in under 30 seconds.
Additionally, now that the script writes to a Cloud SQL database, instead of CSVs, it is easier to track neural network predictions from PyTorch.
I realize there is still much to improve with my project (submit a PR!), but I see my ability to identify bottlenecks and iterate as a great strength. 
I believe this project demonstrates why I am fit for this position.

I hope to hear from you.

Thank you,
