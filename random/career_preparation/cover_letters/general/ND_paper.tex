Dear Hiring Manager,

ND presents an interesting set of opportunities to apply innovative technologies to quantifiable and sustainable recycling. 

These challenges are particularly interesting to me because I feel committed to a good future for our children and I am interested in computer vision and machine learning. 

I have qualifications in applied machine learning which will help decrease the contamination rate in sorted goods and provide a more reusable and recyclable product. 

One area that I am excited to learn more about, which this opportunity presents, is a hands on understanding of industrial optimization and robotics.

I have experience in Excel, but I am confident in my capabilities in Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib, which is a robust data visualization package.

Thank you,
