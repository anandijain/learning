I am a intensely curious and devoted programmer.

I am interested in working with other passionate people at the cutting edge of technology to create unparalleled computational infrastructure.

One way that I see this happening is developing custom SoCs that are built on the open-source RISC-V ISA.

Another area of research that I am very interested in applying to production grade software is differentiable computing.

I think that neural differential equations / dynamical systems is the next evolution in big data / ML architectures.

However, DifferentialEquations.jl, a Julia package that is leading this next phase of computing / modeling, is only recently getting to the point where it can be applied in production, ie. Julia's XLA support, LLVM RISC-V support, and Sparse Matrix optimization.

I believe that I have the ability to motivate others and be excited about the problem and solution.

I know that there is no better feeling than running code and having *finally* work and I want to share that joy with a team.

Additionally, I am committed to being open source and my belief that open source technology presents an immense value proposition.

My philosophy is that the data and tools to develop everything is already out there and inevitably will be easy for anyone to use, so it is in the best interest for companies to capitalize on this by open sourcing tools that will be improved by the community, free of charge.

I think that Goldman Sachs is a team that has similarly curious people that love to get new things to work.
