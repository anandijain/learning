A few years ago I was just starting college as a neuroscience/cs major with very little background in CS. 
After about a year of CS courses, I realized I wanted to start building a larger scale project. 
I have been building a sports odds tracker that runs live DNN and RL models on the data.
Learning the math, language, and use-cases of deep learning is definitely a challenge, but understanding large-scale software development have been more difficult.
I think that hardest challenges were learning about dependencies, scalability, the performance impacts of design choices, and the horrors of poor (self) documentation. 
I am still trying to get over a lot of bad practices and to quote Guido, "code is read much more often than it is written", so I am trying to keep this in mind more when I code.
I will admit that in learning to do this, a lot of effort was spent in refactoring older code, and in the process I have decided to reattempt new custom gym environments hopefully soon. 
Initially I had a repository to house everything (gym envs, scrapers, parsing) and I have started to organize the project into a more functional and intuitive way (I hope). 

# Why do you want to participate in this program? What do you hope to learn and achieve?

"To quote every deep learning paper, DNNs and RL have shown widespread adoption...".
I think that I have some interesting ideas about how we can leverage the technology to make a measurable stride towards general intelligence. 
My worry is that I am fairly new and I haven't trained many large functional models, nor have I spent time working on a large software team.

# What most excites you about deep learning? If you have ideas for what you'd like to work on/learn during the Scholars program, let us know.

1. DeepMind was able to reduce the energy usage of cooling Google's datacenters by 40% using machine learning.
 The recent OpenAI hide-and-seek results are a

# What groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering do you personally identify with?
I identify as LGBT and I am multi/bi racial (Indian and White).

# How did you hear about this program?
I have been a huge fan of OpenAI's mission for a couple of years after learning about Gym and the incredible possibilities of reinforcement learning.
I noticed that there was an internship on the jobs page and that a PHD was not required.
