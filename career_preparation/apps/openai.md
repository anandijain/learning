# Will you be able to dedicate at least 40 hours a week to this program?âœ±

Yes

# Do you have U.S. work authorization, and will you be based in the US for the duration of the program (February 3rd - June 5th)

Yes, yes.

# Describe a software system you built, and a challenge (technical or otherwise) you had to overcome to complete it

A few years ago I was just starting college as a neuroscience major with very little background in CS. After about a year of CS courses (and switching to CS), I realized I wanted to start building a larger scale project that other people could use. I decided to learn Python and basic data scraping and analysis with Pandas. From that I started to build my own Python package (local install only right now) that scrapes sports odds. I think that hardest challenges were learning about dependencies, the performance impacts of design choices, and the horrors of poor (self) documentation. After writing a bunch of code to build the scraper to be able to run constantly, I realized how poor the code design was, so I have spent a good amount of time cleaning up the package to be easier to use for a wider variety of usages.

In building this live-scraper, I wanted to see if a reinforcement learning agent would learn interesting strategies (similar to the hide-and-seek blog post) for learning to hedge bets across different domains (sport, team, player, etc). I have not been able to get my custom environments to train agents that perform well, so I am going to try and rewrite the gym component of the sips package so that the environment is compatible with tf-agents. This would allow me to try a bunch of different algorithms and not require me to implement all of them myself, as making my first DQN was definitely not a walk in the park.

# Why do you want to participate in this program? What do you hope to learn and achieve

I wholeheartedly believe in the mission to create and democratize AGI (as well as the internet and computation). I think that OpenAI's goal is extremely good, but more importantly that the challenges that are faced at OpenAI are not just technical, but ethical. I think that intense inquiry and thought on the decisions made by the general AI community is an important discussion to have and OpenAI is at the heart of this.

I am hoping to expand my ability to contribute to larger codebases and teams. I would like to feel as though the science that I worked on had a measurable impact towards creating AGI.
In terms of specific areas of deep learning, it would be really difficult to choose to work on only robotics, or only NLP. The thing that excites me the most is being around incredibly bright and curious people working on making a better future for everyone.

I feel that I am particularly inexperienced with Multi-Agent RL, but I am really interested in it and want to learn more.

# What most excites you about deep learning? If you have ideas for what you'd like to work on/learn during the Scholars program, let us know

I'm super interested in computer architecture and robotics, so the two ideas that I think would be fun to work on are:

1. I would be interested to see an agent cooperate with users accessing a (GraphQL) database to better exploit temporal/spatial locality. The agent could realize patterns in when data is accessed, which data is accessed together, etc, and deduce where to place all of the memory to speed up reads.

2. I loved watching the rubiks cube videos and the first thing that popped in my mind was, 'when can we use two arms to untie a knot?' which I think would be an incredibly difficult and rewarding task to work on. Additionally, I think that it is important to start putting the arms on moving robots to start to take on tasks that require spatial orientation.

# What groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering do you personally identify with

I identify as LGBT and I am multi/bi racial (Indian and White).

# How did you hear about this program
I have been a huge fan of OpenAI's mission for a couple of years after learning about Gym and the incredible possibilities of reinforcement learning.
I noticed that there was an internship on the jobs page and that a PHD was not required.
